Hello everyone before moving to advance commands , I'll quickly revise which concepts have been covered earlier,
so u guys have seen
1. What is Git?
2. What are the basic git commands?
3. What is github ?
4. What is branching ?
5. What is merging ?

So I hope everything is clear till now !!

Now moving forward 
will see our first advance command that is git rebase 
What is git rebase ?
Used to integrate changes from one branch to another,
So why is there need to use rebase as same work as been done by merge ?
So the reason is in git commit history. What is it will look shortly .

So have a look over here, u guys can also demonstrate this ....
Go to chrome type learngitbranching ....

So can u guys really see any difference in rebase and merge ?
So the difference actually arises in commit history in which rebase actually gives linear commit history
whereas merge gives set of commits to be grouped.

So u saw the difference, that in commit history u see linear commit history using rebase whereas grouped commits using merge

Now will see the next command which is git revert in this command a commited work can be discarded or to be term specific revert
Demo ///

Now will see the difference between git revert and reset 
Demo ...

Now coming to our third command that is git blame 
So this command is used to examine the contents of file line by line how this works will see shortly.

Now the next command that is git diff 
Used to show changes between working directory and stagging area files
Demo///

Now the next command that is git clean
Used to clean/delete untracked files
But what files can be termed as untracked files ?
So the files which are not added or are in stagging area are termed as untracked files.
Demo ///
